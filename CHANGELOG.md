## tsMuxeR 2.9.0

- `--layer-break-guard-before=<MB>`: size the guard zone before the layer break on its own, instead of the fixed 4 MB margin, for media that are defective on both sides of the transition. The default stays asymmetric (the measured defect sits at the start of the next layer)
- GUI: the "BDMV folder to ISO" tab gains an optional "fill before the break" control with a short note on when to use it, and a live fit estimate that shows the image size against the disc's Free Sectors and whether it will fit

## tsMuxeR 2.8.1

- GUI: show the version number in the window title (previously only the git commit was shown)
- GUI: stop the "#" column header from overlapping the select-all checkbox in the track list

## tsMuxeR 2.8.0

Multi-layer disc authoring, on top of jaminmc/tsMuxer. See docs/DISC_AUTHORING.md.

- `--bdmv-to-iso`: wrap an existing unprotected BDMV folder into a burnable BD-ROM ISO byte for byte, keeping the BD-J menus and all clip and playlist references intact (no re-mux, no re-numbering)
- `--layer-break-guard=<MB>`: zero-fill the defect-prone sectors around each layer transition of BD-R/RE DL and BD-R XL media, so the movie plays across the break. Validated on real hardware, where it absorbed a genuine layer-1 defect
- `--layer-break-lbn=<sector[,sector...]>`: set the layer break sector(s); takes a comma list for 100 GB (2 breaks) and 128 GB (3 breaks) BD-R XL
- `--disc-size` and `--allow-oversize`: abort, or warn, before muxing if the estimated image will not fit the target disc
- ISO writer: multi-sector directories and 32-bit object IDs, so full retail discs (hundreds of files) can be wrapped
- Propagate asynchronous write errors so a truncated disc is no longer reported as a successful mux; fix a buffer leak on the write path
- Skip unsupported subtitle coding types in the Blu-ray playlist with a warning instead of aborting a finished, multi-hour mux
- Guard a divide-by-zero in the discovery phase, and stop a bogus "MLP is not standard" warning when a TrueHD track is merged with an AC-3 core from a file
- GUI: a "BDMV folder to ISO" tab with a layer-break calculator (paste the disc's Free Sectors from ImgBurn and the break sectors are worked out), colour-coded guard hints, disc-type and divisibility sanity warnings, and a BD-R XL at-your-own-risk confirmation
- GUI: dual-layer capacity and guard controls on the Blu-ray outputs, and runtime language switching that also updates the hand-built widgets
- GUI: added Japanese, and completed German, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Russian and Chinese to full coverage
- Windows: the release binaries build Qt 6.8.3 statically with the qt6windows7 patches, so the standard 32-bit and 64-bit builds run on Windows 7 and newer. This replaces the earlier separate Qt5 build. The workflow builds Qt, qttools and a static zlib with Ninja

## tsMuxeR 2.7.2
- **Qt6 GUI:** The default GUI build uses Qt6. In this fork the Windows binaries are built with the qt6windows7 patches, so they still run on Windows 7 (see docs/COMPILING.md)
- Added language selection to the video track options in the GUI, matching the existing audio/subtitle language selector
- Fixed AAC audio not being detected in MP4/MOV containers (reported as "Can't detect stream type"), caused by missing ADTS header generation when ESDS parsing did not set the AAC flag, and by channel count corruption from the AudioSpecificConfig channel configuration index
- Fixed MKV and MOV/MP4 demuxers returning absolute timecodes instead of relative delays, causing audio/video sync offsets (e.g. delay stored in differing track start times or edit lists) to be lost during remuxing
- GUI: Make meta file editable with manual override support, allowing users to manually edit the meta file directly in the GUI and apply advanced options not available through the visual interface
- GUI: Added "Reset meta to auto-generated" button to revert manual meta edits
- GUI: Support for merge-ac3-file option for TrueHD tracks, enabling TrueHD+AC-3 merge in the GUI with external .ac3 file input
- GUI: Preserve custom Blu-ray chapters when input files change
- Introduced AV1 codec support in MPEG-TS, implementing the AOM "Carriage of AV1 in MPEG-2 TS" draft specification
- AV1 muxing from MKV and MP4/MOV containers into MPEG-TS with start-code based OBU format and emulation prevention bytes
- AV1 demuxing from MPEG-TS to raw .obu elementary stream files
- AV1 Sequence Header parsing for profile, level, resolution, bit depth, color primaries, transfer characteristics, and HDR/WCG detection
- AV1 PMT descriptors: Registration descriptor (format_identifier 'AV01') and AV1 video descriptor (tag 0x80) per AOM spec
- AV1 keyframe detection for random access point signaling in MPEG-TS adaptation field
- Introduced automatic FPS detection from container metadata (MKV default_duration, MP4/MOV timescale) for codecs that lack timing info in the elementary stream (e.g. AV1)
- Fixed MP4/MOV files larger than 4GB not being read correctly due to compact atom size overflow
- Fixed AAC MPEG-2 TS descriptor (was disabled with early return; now emits proper AAC descriptor tag 0x2B)
- Fixed TrueHD/MLP TS descriptor to emit Blu-ray compliant HDMV registration descriptor in Blu-ray mode, or SMPTE-RA 'mlpa' registration descriptor otherwise
- Updated GUI to recognize AV1 codec: file dialog filters (.obu), About dialog, BD V3 auto-selection, and video track settings
- Updated all GUI About dialog translations (EN, DE, ES, FR, HE, RU, ZH) to include H.266/VVC and AV1 in supported codecs list
- Introduced Matroska (MKV/MKA) muxing support with EBML writing, cluster-based output, Cues index, and SeekHead
- Supported codecs for MKV output: H.264, HEVC, VVC, AV1, VC-1, MPEG-2 (video); AAC, AC3, E-AC3, DTS, TrueHD, LPCM, MP3 (audio); SRT, PGS (subtitles)
- Added CodecPrivate generation for H.264 (AVCDecoderConfigurationRecord), HEVC (HEVCDecoderConfigurationRecord), AV1 (AV1CodecConfigurationRecord), AAC (AudioSpecificConfig), and VVC
- Added MKV radio button to the GUI output panel with save dialog filter and auto-detection of .mkv/.mka extensions
- Updated all GUI translations (DE, ES, FR, HE, RU, ZH) with MKV muxing strings
- Added missing Matroska codec ID constants (A_DTS, A_EAC3, A_TRUEHD, A_MPEG/L3, V_MPEG2)
- Fixed aspect ratio override (`ar` parameter in metafile) being ignored for MPEG-2 and other video streams, so the original stream aspect ratio was always retained
- Added Opus audio codec support for MPEG-TS and MKV muxing, including OpusHead codec-private handling and TS descriptor generation per RFC 7845
- Added FLAC audio codec support for MKV muxing and demux output, including STREAMINFO codec-private parsing
- Introduced a stream discovery phase that probes all tracks before muxing begins, collecting codec properties (channels, sample rate, resolution, HDR metadata, codec-private data) upfront to prevent late-initialization bugs in container headers
- Generalized early codec-private propagation from containers (MKV, MP4/MOV) to all stream readers via `applyDiscoveryData()`, replacing the previous Opus-specific workaround
- Added `getTrackCodecPrivate()` support for MP4/MOV containers
- Added FLAC and Opus codec entries to USAGE documentation
